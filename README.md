# PowerBi-Week
PowerBi Week Course with Leonardo Karpinski

Greetings!
This project was created with a help of a Power Bi Trainer - Leonardo Karpinski. With this quick course I was able to cycle through the basic and intermediate functions of PowerBi program. Thanks to Leonardo I created a dashboard with information about fictional company and its workers - the revenue that they generate, sales , orders as well as a ranking of workers and their scores. All that information binded in a elegant and easy to access form of an interactive dashboard.
Dashboard contains KPI's, charts, tooltips, active buttons, filter panes which i hope show my familirization with the PowerBI program. My goal is to discover the deeps of this extremly useful program. 
Hope You enjoy the project.
Thank You.
